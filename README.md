# Added Features

1. Navigation bar is fixed at the top of the view.
2. Animation added to the about section's text like "Hi! I'm Kaung" sliding, "A junior at UC Berkeley ..." fading in, and "Computer Security, Computer Architecutre,..." typing with a blinking carnet.
3. My photo (:/) with an animation of bouncing when the page is loaded.

Notes: I might have certain skeleton code fixed and certain exercise abit deviated from spec to make the website a bit more responsive with my added features.
